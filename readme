Driver options

Use the host and port options to tell the driver where to find the IP-100:

[IP100]
    driver = user.ip100
    port = 80
    host = 192.168.1.12
    poll_interval = 2 # how often to query the IP-100, in seconds
    # The number of seconds to wait for the newtork to come up.
    # (Useful on a Raspberry Pi, 10s recommended.)
    wait_for_network = 0
    # The number of times to try to read from the IP100 before giving up.
    max_tries = 3
    # The number of seconds to wait before retrying a read from the IP100.
    retry_wait = 5
